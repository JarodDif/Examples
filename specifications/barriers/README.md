# Barrier synchronization

A barrier is a synchronization facility which ensures that a group of threads
all reach the barrier before they can advance.

Such a barrier is useful when parallel computations are done in two or more
steps and results from all threads are needed to continue.

## Barrier.tla

A specification of an abstract Barrier.

The usual typing `TypeOK` invariant is defined.

Another property to show that processes cannot leave the barrier as long as 
there are others outside of it is also given (see `BarrierProperty`)

A model with $N = 6$ that verifies both properties is provided. 

## Barriers.tla

A specification of a Reusable Barrier synchronization facility using as
presented in the INFO09012 Parallel Programming course in ULi√®ge by 
Prof. Pascal Fontaine.

The barrier consists of two waiting chambers `a1-a6` and `a7-a12`. 
The last process entering a waiting chamber signals the appropriate semaphore
and allows processes to pass to the next section.
Using two such waiting chambers makes sure a process leaving the barrier cannot
reenter and pass through the whole barrier again.

## Invariants

- `TypeOK` is the usual typing invariant. The typing invariant alone cannot
  determine the range of values the semaphores can take.
- `LockInv` is used to represent the mutual exclusion inside critical sections
  present in the specification.
- `Inv` is the main invariant representing most properties of this double 
  barrier construction.
  Due to the symmetry between the two waiting rooms, there are pairs of clauses
  that represent the same property for each section.
- `FlushInv` are two additional clauses needed to prove the refinement.
  It shows that once a waiting section is opened, all processes can pass.

A model `Barriers.cfg` with $N = 6$ that verifies these four invariants is 
provided.

## Refinement

A refinement towards an abstract Barrier specification is proven with TLAPS.
